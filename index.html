            <h2>Sherlock Holmes</h2>

        </div>

        <p>"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never 
            guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended 
            by doing."</p>

        <p>"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been 
            watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of 
            Miss Irene Adler."</p>

        <p>"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. 
            I will tell you, however. I left the house a 
            little after eight o'clock this morning in the 
            character of a groom out of work. There is a 
            wonderfulsympathy and freemasonry among horsey
            men. Be one of them, and you will know all that 
            there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It 
            is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but 
            built out in front right up to the road, two stories. 
            Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the 
            right side, well furnished, with long windows 
            almost to the floor, and those preposterous 
            English window fasteners which a child could open. 
            Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the 
            passage window could be reached from the top of the 
            coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely 
            from every point of view, but without noting anything 
            else of interest.</p>

        <p>"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, 
            that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one 
            wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing 
            down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a 
            glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and 
            as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, 
            to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the 
            neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, 
            but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."</p>

        <p>"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.</p>

        <p>"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. 
            She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. 
            So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, 
            sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns 
            at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, 
            except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good 
            deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls 
            less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey 
            Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman 
            as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from 
            Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened 
            to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near 
            Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of 
            campaign.</p>


        <p>"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the 
            matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the 
            relation between them, and what the object of his repeated 
            visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If 
            the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to 
            his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue 
            of this question depended whether I should continue my work 
            at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's 
            chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it 
            widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you 
            with these details, but I have to let you see my little 
            difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."</p>
